- [ ] distribution of response times for each question (histograms)
- [ ] # of students who took longer than 20 minutes (histogram or table)
- [ ] "trajectories"  between 2013 and 2014 - quantify changes along x and y axis
        relate to code of what changed
- [ ] cluster absolute time stamps    
- [ ] create sample "data files" to provide along with software 
- [ ] modify files to work with 2013 (or any) data
