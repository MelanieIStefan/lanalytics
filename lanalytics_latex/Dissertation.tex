\abstract{%
One of the methods for the measurement of students knowledge and comprehension of a topic is through low-stake high-frequency quizzes. These can provide constant information about the group performance and about the general group understanding about specific concepts and topics. This analysis requires processing the quizzes constantly in order to detect and understand the student learning. For this reason,  the lanalytics package is introduced as a tool to administer and analyze quizzes in different grouping levels: per person, per quiz and per group. In addition, the lanalytics dashboard is created as a user interface for the package. Together, they can inform the group necessities to the instructors in order to allow them to adapt their tests difficulties according to these needs.}
